                MOUSEHOLE (“Mowzel”), described by Dylan Thomas as the prettiest village in England,
                is set around a tidal harbour and small sandy beaches, once home to the traditional
                pilchard-fishing fleet.

                The harbour offers safe swimming at high tide and beachcombing at low tide.
                At the nearby rockpools there is a natural sea-bathing pool for children.

                Full of winding paths and picturesque cottages, Mousehole is now
                largely a conservation area.

                In December and January the spectacular harbour lights and traditional Tom Bawcock
                celebrations (the legend brought to life in Antonia Barber’s book “The Mousehole
                Cat”) make Mousehole a magical place. Occasional south-easterly storms can send
                waves crashing over the harbour walls, whilst the harbour itself is protected by
                its winter barrier.

                Mousehole is a joy to explore - tiny paths, hidden clusters of cottages, constantly
                changing views. Keigwin Place has a plaque to Dolly Pentreath, the last Cornish-speaker.
                A mile east along the coast, the former Penlee lifeboat station is now a memorial
                garden to the crew of the Solomon Brown lifeboat - all of the 8 crew were Mousehole
                men who lost their lives in a heroic rescue attempt in 1981.
