            CAROLINE COTTAGE is a deceptively spacious granite cottage, situated on the
            main street and backing onto Keigwin Place some 100 metres from the beach and harbour.
        </p>
        <p>
            The bedrooms and bathroom are at street level and the living areas upstairs. From
            the open-plan lounge (c. 18') and balcony there are wonderful views over the rooftops (complete
            with seagulls) and St Clement’s Isle, and across Mount’s Bay to St Michael’s Mount.
            The spacious kitchen/dining room (c. 20') has a traditional Cornish range and a well-equipped
            wood-fitted kitchen. The table seats 8. Our studio annexe, “The Dungeon”, is at a lower level on Keigwin
            Square. Double futon plus shower.
        </p>
        <p>
            We provide lots of books, games, dvds and puzzles for all ages. We have recently installed W-Fi.
        </p>

            2001 was our first letting year - we continue to run bookings ourselves so that
            we can respond in person to your queries. After your stay we welcome any suggestions
            for added comfort. Our aim is that you find the cottage both beautiful and homely,
            to make your holiday a real pleasure – and hopefully one that you will look forward
            to repeating!
        </p>
        <p>
            Our booking information includes more useful information on the cottage and village.
            We offer some flexibility e.g. for short or off-peak stays. For most of us holidays
            are a well-earned break, so we have been keen to make the cottage attractive and
            comfortable for maximum enjoyment.
